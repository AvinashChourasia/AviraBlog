        <p>News is information about current events. This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth,
            printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and
            witnesses to events. News is sometimes called "hard news" to differentiate it from soft media.
        </p>
        <p>Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment,
            economy, business, fashion, entertainment, and sport, as well as quirky or unusual events. Government
            proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news
            since ancient times. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and
            espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout history, people have transported new information through oral means. Having developed in China
            over centuries, newspapers became established in Europe during the early modern period. In the 20th century,
            radio and television became an important means of transmitting news. Whilst in the 21st, the internet has
            also begun to play a similar role.</p>
        <p>A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web
            consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in
            reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until
            2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group,
            and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring
            the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media
            outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing
            quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and
            single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content
            to a blog.</p>
        <p>The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that
            facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or
            computer programming. Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been
            required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer
            enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online
            comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In that sense,
            blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to
            post on their blogs but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[3] However,
            there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.</p>
        <p>Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts
            to science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or online brand
            advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links
            to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability of readers to leave publicly
            viewable comments, and interact with other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of
            many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online comments to remove hate speech
            or other offensive content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs),
            photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or "vlogs"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In
            education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as edublogs. Microblogging is
            another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.</p>
        <p>'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media, especially when
            the content is long-form and one creates and shares content on regular basis. So, one could be maintaining a
            blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram.</p>
